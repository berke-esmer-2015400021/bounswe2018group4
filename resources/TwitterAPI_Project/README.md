This is an example project which aims to bring in practice with using Twitter API.

Link to project: http://memorist.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ (which runs on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance). However you might not be able to reach it time to time since we have limited usage time with the server.

If you click on the link to try our system, it woud be nice if you can mailto:berke.esmer@boun.edu.tr to inform the usage. Since this account is on the limited usage, we cannot afford to run it all time :/
